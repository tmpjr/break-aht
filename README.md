break-aht
=========

A simple BreakOut clone written using LibGDX (Java) and Box2d. It can be deployed to android, windows, ios and OSX. This project is a learning tool for myself and anyone else who wishes to learn libgdx and Box2d. I appreciate all feedback especially since parts really need to be cleaned up and refactored.
