break-aht
=========

A simple BreakOut clone written using LibGDX (Java) and Box2d. It can be deployed to android, windows, ios and OSX. This project is a learning tool for myself and anyone else who wishes to learn libgdx and Box2d. I appreciate all feedback especially since parts really need to be cleaned up and refactored. 

#### TODO

* Add an asset manager to load and clean up game objects like textures and sounds
* Improve and consolidate the level selection and screen management
* Fix ball movement to prevent flat/horizontal movement 

As of now this game works and serves as a good base to learn Box2D, sprites and moving Box2D objects, and a simple Scene2D menu system.
